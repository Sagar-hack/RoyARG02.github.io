## Motivation

Working with Flutter Web, I thought about using my skills to make a **"Web-only"** Flutter project.

Initial implementations were unsatisfying though, as Flutter web was still in beta, and it didn't quite handle mouse events and scrolling the way I hoped(This was during early 2020, I'm sure Flutter web is much better now).

It led me to use HTML and CSS instead. I also happen to complete some courses on Coursera on these topics, which were extremely helpful.

I tried to make it visually similar to, if I someday make up my mind to build it, the Flutter web version, but I took some liberties in giving it its flavour.

I tried to avoid **JavaScript** as much as I can, so if you are looking for some `*.js` files in the source, don't bother(_until dark mode_ :new_moon: _is implemented_) :wink:.
